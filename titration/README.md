Nutrients titration in tap water.

Cellmax Hydro Bloom X+Y nutrients were used.
Since this is a two-component nutrient, both components were added in equal proportions.
E.g. 1 mL/L nutrient concentration means that both 1 mL/L of X and 1 mL/L of Y are present in a solution.

During titration 1 mL of each component was added to the tank containing 10 L of tap water every 15 min.
Solution was mixed with a pump.
